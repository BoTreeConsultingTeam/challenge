1.1 Assume there is a Stack data structure available capable of holding only Integers.
	  Now suppose a client performs an intermixed sequence of Push and Pop operations onto the stack.
		The push operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the stack; the pop operations print out the return values.

		Given the above scenario, which of the following sequences could not occur and identify the value which caused the sequence to be evaluated as invalid? 

			4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5
			4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
			2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
			4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
			1 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7 0
			0 4 6 5 3 8 1 7 2 9
			1 4 7 9 8 6 5 3 0 2
			2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 9 0
