Program 1 : Write a program to simulate the push/pop functionality of a Stack. The requirements are

a) It should be possible to PUSH numbers (0 - 9) on the stack only in the proper sequence. Meaning, the allowed sequence is PUSH 0, PUSH 1, PUSH 2, PUSH 3, PUSH 4, PUSH 5, PUSH 6, PUSH 7, PUSH 8, PUSH9. It should not be possible to skip numbers in between. PUSH 2,  PUSH 4 is not allowed.

b) Given a random pattern of numbers, the program should be able to validate if it is possible to generate the given pattern using a number of PUSH - POP operations. 

For example: the pattern  4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5  is achievable using the following
PUSH - POP sequence 
PUSH 0, PUSH 1, PUSH 2, PUSH 3, PUSH 4, POP 4, POP 3, POP 2, POP 1, POP 0, PUSH 5, PUSH 6, PUSH 7, PUSH 8, PUSH 9, POP 9, POP 8, POP 7, POP 6, POP 5
The results from the POP commands can be printed on the console to show the pattern. This is a valid pattern and can be achieved using PUSH - POP
