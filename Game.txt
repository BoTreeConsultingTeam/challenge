Program 2 : Kids are playing a game of Elimination. The rules of the game are

a) Suppose there are M kids. They stand in a circle and pick a random number N which is less than M.

b) They start counting from 1 to N and the kid at position N is eliminated. They resume counting from position N + 1 starting from 1.

c) This continues until there is only one kid left. The last Kid standing is declared the Winner.
Write an algorithm which, given values of M and N, identifies the position which would make her the winner.
